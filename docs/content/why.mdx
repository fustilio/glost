# Why GLOST?

## The Challenge

Building language learning applications requires representing text with rich annotations: translations, pronunciations, difficulty levels, grammar information, and cultural context.

Common approaches have trade-offs:
- **Plain text + offsets**: Fragile offset matching, lacks standard structure
- **HTML + attributes**: Mixes presentation with data, limited structure
- **Custom JSON**: Each project creates its own format, limiting interoperability

## GLOST's Approach

GLOST provides a standardized syntax tree for multilingual annotated text:

### Standards-Based

Built on [nlcst](https://github.com/syntax-tree/nlcst) (Natural Language Concrete Syntax Tree), part of the [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/) ecosystem, providing compatibility with existing tools and community-driven standards.

### Concrete Syntax Tree

Preserves all details including whitespace and punctuation, which benefits language learners who need to see authentic text.

### Multi-Language Support

Supports multiple languages using ISO-639 codes, with flexible script and transcription system handling.

### Rich Metadata

Supports comprehensive word annotations:

### Extensible

The extension system allows custom processing for features like frequency analysis, translations, and transcriptions.

### Type-Safe

Full TypeScript support with type guards for safe node handling.

## Use Cases

GLOST is used for language learning apps, reader applications, corpus linguistics, interactive fiction, and dictionary tools.
